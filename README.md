# 👋 Hello, World!

🎓 I'm **Vo Quang Chien**, a university student from Vietnam 🇻🇳.

I'm passionate about **Full-Stack Development**, **Blockchain**, and **AI**.

My main programming languages are **Python, and TypeScript**.

I'm a big fan of Linux, the terminal, and Vim. I enjoy ricing my setup and constantly tinkering with my dev environment to make it look prettier.

> BTW, I use Arch Linux 🐧.
